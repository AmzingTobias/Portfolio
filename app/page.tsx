            Hi, my name is Tobias. I&apos;m from a small town in Norfolk,
            England. I&apos;m {getAge()} years old and attending Loughborough
            University, Iâ€™m in my final year studying computer science BSc with
            plans to graduate in summer 2024. I&apos;m currently on track for a
            First. I&apos;m passionate about Formula 1, supporting Mercedes, I
            watch almost every race, including the ones I have to wake up at 6am
            for. I spend lots of my spare time playing games, watching films,
            listening to music, and hanging out with my friends and family.
            I&apos;m hard working and very dedicated, with my work ethic having
            been described as &quot;exceptional&quot;. The primary reason for
            this is my passion for technology, it has always been my interest
            throughout school, and I&apos;ve been very fortunate to know that I
            want to be a Software Engineer.

            I have a passion for computers and programming, having done so since
            a young age. I&apos;ve built my own computer, and am regularly
            called upon via friends and family for any technology related
            problems. The first programming language I really used was python,
            but since starting University I have learnt C++, Java,
            Javascript/Typescript (and the different frameworks to create
            frontend and backend applications). I have experience in setting up
            a Jenkins pipeline for automated testing, and configuring a VPS to
            host my own websites / server.
